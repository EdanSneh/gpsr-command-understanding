        <p>Given a command that someone said to a household helper robot, rephrase it in your own words.
          Don't try to be overly formal, simply write what you would say if you wanted the robot to accomplish the same command.</p>
    <p>Try to
    <ul>
        <li>Capture all of the same information as the original command</li>
        <li>Write something different than the original command</li>
        <li>Use natural english</li>
        <li>Consider varying sentence structure and using different words that mean roughly the same thing</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>Original: Pick up the apple from the table and place it on the counter<br/>
        Rephrased: <span class="green">Move the apple on the table to the counter please</span></p>


        <p>Original: Take Fred from the bedroom to the kitchen<br/>
        Rephrased: <span class="green"> Get Fred from the bedroom to the kitchen</span></p>


        <p>Original: Go to the foyer, meet Alice, and lead her to the living room.<br/>
        Rephrased: <span class="red">Guide Alice to the living room.</span><br/>
        <strong>Reason: </strong> The rephrased command doesn't include all of the information from the original command. Specifically, it doesn't include that Alice can be found in the foyer.</p>

        <p>Original: Find a person in the bedroom and tell them the time.<br/>
        Rephrased: <span class="red"> Tell the time then find someone in the bedroom.</span><br/>
        <strong>Reason: </strong> The rephrased command changes the meaning of the command. Specifically, it tells the robot to tell the user the time, when it should tell the robot to tell someone in the bedroom the time.</p>
